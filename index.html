      The Moriquendi (singular Moriquendë: also named the Hisildi and Kaliondi) are the Elves of Darkness. They are, in essence, the Elves that did not join the Great Journey over the sea and behold the light of the Two Trees in Valinor. They lingered on the shores of Middle-earth or, indeed, never passed the Blue Mountain in the east of Beleriand or the Misty Mountains further to the east.

          <p>
            As a young Dark Elf you loved to pull out a spider's legs one by one and watch him twitch helplessly. This bored you after a while, and so you began to try out the spells you had learnt. Dozens of spiders burnt, froze or were pulled apart in your morbid experiments. Your prowess and steady mind did not go unnoticed, and you, the child of a prominent noble House, were permitted into the Academy. After years of tedious study fraught with intrigue, you finally graduated and entered the maelstrom of Dark Elven politics. Now, several assassinations later, you have firmly established yourself as Leader.
